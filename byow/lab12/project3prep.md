# Project 3 Prep

**For tessellating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way.
After looking at your own implementation, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab.
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?**

Answer: I don't have access to the staff solution yet.

**Can you think of an analogy between the process of tessellating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways?
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?**

Answer: Yes, when making hallways and rooms, we will be tessellating many rectangle of different sizes instead of hexagons.

**If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tessellating hexagons.**

Answer: I would create a method to designate a part of the map to a rectangle. The method takes the dimensions of the rectangle, the desired position, and the desired type of the tile as its arguments.

**What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?**

Answer: A hallway is a room of a smaller size, especially a smaller width.
